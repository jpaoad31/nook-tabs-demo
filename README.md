# nook-tabs

A demo website that displays a rondom image of an insect from the game _Animal Crossing: New Leaf_ along with its description.

This could eventually be used to create a chrome extension that themes the new tab page to an insect based on insects that could be caught based on the current time of day and season.

For now it is merely a simple demo.
